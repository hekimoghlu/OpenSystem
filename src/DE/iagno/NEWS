3.36.0 – March 9, 2020
=============================

Here is a new stable release! This cycle has seen the
complete update of the application, incluting the new
Reverse Reversi game, various interesting options, as
a way to start on other positions, or an highlight of
playable tiles. Thanks for all translators, who had a
hard work to do with new strings. Good play everyone!

3.35.91 – February 15, 2020
=============================

The “Escape” key works again during a game. Also, the
code that manages inputs (keyboard and mouse) changed
a bit, so please have fun testing that all is working
as expected. Finally, help had cosmetic improvements.

3.35.90 – February 3, 2020
=============================

The History button is now drawn using the same images
as the board; it removes the need to ensure a working
font is installed. It also allowed to optimize a bit.
Also, the "Vary start position" option now enables or
disables the human opening when on a two-player game.
Transition to the game also changed on large windows.
Finally, help pages were reworked and are up-to-date.

3.35.3 – January 6, 2020
=============================

There is now a new option (not checked by default) to
highlight the playable tiles (yes, the playable ones,
this time), for making the game easier for newcomers.
In the New Game screen, arrows have been added to the
menubuttons for clarifying a bit what they are. Also,
the window layout has improved on phone-like screens,
with the game name being displayed in a bottom bar. A
final thank to Andre Klapper, for updating user help.

  Spanish: Daniel Mustieles

3.35.2 – November 23, 2019
=============================

The most visible change is probably the first part of
the replacement of the “Iagno” name by “Reversi”; the
help is currently not updated. Other things are a bit
more helpful for the developpers than to an end-user:
there is now a “--print-logs” command-line option for
recording a game; when configuring meson using option
“-Dperfs_tests=true”, you can now check if the AI has
been changed and test it for performance regressions;
finally, Iagno should now be activatable using D-Bus.

3.35.1 – October 12, 2019
=============================

Many changes! The biggest one is of course that Iagno
now allows to play the reversed reversi game, that is
played like an usual reversi game, but where the goal
is to finish with less tiles than your opponent. Also
there is now a toggle to start with different initial
positions randomly; and for two-player games, this is
replaced by an old-style opening, where players place
the four initial tiles on the board. And also another
toggle to alternate who starts when a user is playing
multiple times in a row. This is an exciting release!

3.34.0 – September 10, 2019
=============================

New stable release! There has been some changes since
last stable release, in the UI (a better layout, that
allows running on phone-sized screens) and in the AI,
but –spoiler– more and bigger things will come in the
next cycle, so consider this release as a transition.
Anyway, that’s a great and pleasant one, and as there
have been no bugs spotted since last beta, it should,
as usual, be rock-solid. Have fun enjoying this 3.34!

3.33.92 – September 3rd, 2019

There is no code change, release for the translators.

  Spanish: Daniel Mustieles
  Turkish: Sabri Ünal

3.33.91 – August 17, 2019
=============================

Some more AI things: had to adjust a bit their level,
as they were too hard (!). Other than that, one small
bug fixed, and some translations updated. Looks good!

Translations updated:
  Czech: Marek Černocký
  British English: Bruce Cowan
  Icelandic: Sveinn í Felli
  Indonesian: Kukuh Syafaat
  Romanian: Daniel Șerbănescu
  Swedish: Anders Jonsson

3.33.90 – August 5, 2019
=============================

The UI has changed a bit. The scorer is not displayed
anymore, as it was suggesting the good strategy would
be to turn as many pieces of the opponent as possible
during a game (hint: it is not); it has been replaced
by a simple indication of the current player, visible
in the headerbar. The New Game button was moved also,
allowing to draw the board centered. All this permits
to make the game able to run on small screens, and it
probably makes the window layout a bit cleaner. For a
similar reason, the themes dialog has gone and is now
replaced by a submenu of the hamburger menu. Note, if
you are a packager: GSound replaced the old Canberra.

Translations updated:
  Basque: Asier Sarasua Garmendia
  Spanish: Daniel Mustieles

3.33.5 – July 22, 2019
=============================

Just trying to fix build on some platforms.

Translations updated:
  Croatian: Goran Vidović
  Indonesian: Kukuh Syafaat
  Brazilian Portuguese: Rafael Fontenelle

3.33.4 – July 15, 2019
=============================

Many changes; please, have fun testing. First of all,
there is a new AI (for Medium and Hard); it is only a
depth 3 (for Hard) instead of a depth 6, and so there
should never be a lag again; and it is a bit harder I
think –at least, it defeats usually the old AI– while
using mostly the same tricks, as its strategy feels a
bit more obscure. Secondly, if you play with a mouse,
the currently targetted tile is highlighted, if it is
playable; that feels not too much disturbing, but may
be a bit reassuring sometimes. Thirdly, an option has
been added to highlight the opponent tiles that might
be turned by a ply; that should be helpful for casual
players and newbies. And, trying to play (using mouse
or keyboard) on an occupied tile (briefly) highlights
the playable tiles (this might evolve in the future).

Translation updated:
  Greek: Efstathios Iosifidis

3.33.2 – May 22, 2019
=============================

The AI is now five times faster, for similar results.

Translations updated:
  Croatian: Goran Vidović
  Danish: Ask Hjorth Larsen

3.32.0 – March 11, 2019
=============================

New stable release! Since the last one, the animation
displayed at the end of the game is more reliable and
can be undone for displaying the final board, and the
code has seen many improvements, fixing glitches here
and there; but most of the changes are under the hood
with a switch to Meson, and the use of the Gitlab-CI.

Since last unstable release, there is an unfullscreen
button added (the application was not prepared at all
until now to fullscreen), and some keyboard shortcuts
to improve the keyboard play when using some locales.

3.31.91 – February 20, 2019
=============================

The user can now display the final state of the game,
by undoing after (or during) the final animation; and
this animation is also more reliable (it was randomly
failing). Also, the Adwaita (blue) theme that is used
as default already if the user changes GNOME settings
to always use dark theme is now also default when the
Gtk theme is Adwaita-dark. Other than that, many code cleanings and various small fixes (highlight, focus).

3.31.90 – February 5, 2019
=============================

Only technical things, but big ones:
 * Iagno switched to Meson;
 * it can now be built by the Gitlab CI;
 * it uses now the org.gnome.Reversi application-id.
Many thanks to Bilal Elmoussaoui for all that.
We should be good for the 3.32 release, great!
