# Style & GIMP

GIMP has the capability to adapt very well with many styles and ways to painting from the well-formed to personal and/or customized styles. Is evident that each artist do paintings with our own styles (or 'unawarely' considered as theirs) or using some traditional manner of the painting. So, any kind of software to digital painting has a UI and that creates certain conditions, many times not specifically and/or purposely, and superposes the 'inner' style painting on our's style. This is more common when the apps are deeply based upon tool presets… and where the application is viewed or is interpreted more as preset collections ready for the painting.

To explain it better I think usable this metaphor:

* All language is a kind of UI software, this "feature" permits ourselves to exchanging /experiencing /practicing /making /learning /teaching things with thoughts /talking /seeing /showing and writing things;
 * As any language or any software's UI, it has an strong relationship with "environment" where is molded;
 * The 'style' or 'our own way' to expressing sensations, ideas in the art form is molded by the UI;
 * The language is molded by the influences and relations with UI;
 * So, different software's UI promote naturally an imprinting on the our own styles in an unaware way;
 * If we have languages, UI, where the capabilities are in some way expressing with a inherent 'style', the resulting style is in part also an heritage of that ...
* all things, that we do with a software also will be influenced (more or less) by it.

When we are using a tool preset to painting anything, is important know the designer of the preset and his style… so, is probable that the way and how the preset is working/showing the results are more aligned with designer's style than that of the user that using it.

So, is possible that using different applications our 'style' could be influenced by them, read the interesting chat discussion that I did with Elias Silveira, questions 3 and 4). I intend discuss this better on the next point on Prêt-à-porter.

## Tool Preset as Prêt-à-porter
Since is introduced the Tool Presets on GIMP (when I began utilize, on 2.6+ release, them were already present), it becomes an application capable to record the our way painting's style… and is possible also to share them with other painters and common users.

In this sense the French term "Prêt-à-porter" (Ready-to-use) from the fashion is important to understand why reason the presets have inner an way to understand the painting and therefore have an own style.

In many situations the user can, if he wants, customize a "prêt-a-porter" the tool preset, but all depends if the application has an easier way to do this… many times the approach is very complex and hard to understand for the artists.

Is possible that a certain rules these presets could cause in our styles… mainly if this fact is not clear for the users, in this sense, I think very important to know well these aspects during the design of presets, mainly if we have intention to share them. So, is very important for the default presets on the painting applications, to have an approach more classical for the painting techniques, must be more possibly 'basics'. As advice I read today a quote very interesting wrote by Brian Eno that is useful in this issue about Tool Presets as Prêt-à-porter:

"Stop thinking about art works as objects, and start thinking about them as triggers for experiences."

## Simulacro on paint dynamics
Has a tendency to explain the realty as place ideal where the focus is the simulacro, the copy of the copy, the hiperealism rappresents this tendency in the art and fine arts.
Sensations that this apple is so real that it seems made of plastic material or 'fake'.
The tools presets and paint dynamics are artefacts to simulate and certain sense a simulacro of painting techniques... the author of presets and paint dynamics is getting the imprinting of own emotions e mimics.
To build good paint dynamics is more difficult what we can think, the emotions, the mimics must be considered as important variables on that.
