= gtk-doc-1.X =
This document attempts to reverse engineer some design decisions in 
gtk-doc-1.X.

== sgml-ids ==
When creating SGML IDS, we append ":CAPS" to all
all-caps identifiers to prevent name clashes (SGML ids are case-insensitive).
(It basically never is the case that mixed-case identifiers would collide.)

Unfortunately we create ambiguous ids. The document structure ids are e.g.
GtkWidget.{top_of_page,synopsis,object-hierarchy,...}
and that is ambiguous with eventual structure member of the same name.

cd tests
find . -name "*.xml" -exec grep -o "id=\"[a-zA-Z_:.\-]*\"" {} \; | sort | uniq

== section-ids ==
gtk-doc differentiates between plain-sections and gobject-sections:
+---------+----------------+
| type    | section-id     |
+---------+----------------+
| plain   | $module-$title |
| gobject | $title         |
+---------+----------------+

- links to #GtkWidget would go to $title
- linking to the struct would need #GtkWidget-struct
