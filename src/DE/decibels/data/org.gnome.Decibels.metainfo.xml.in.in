  <description>
    <p>An audio player that just plays audio files. It doesn't require an organized music library and won't overload you with tons of functionality.</p>
    <p>Audio Player still offers advanced features such as:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>An elegant waveform of the track</li>
      <li>Adjustable playback speed</li>
      <li>Easy seek controls</li>
      <li>Playing multiple files at the same time</li>
    </ul>
