    <title>&Evolution; API Reference</title>

    <partintro>
      <para>
	This part presents the class and function reference for the
	different libraries and interfaces that &Evolution; provides.
	Classes are described together with their methods; individual
	functions are grouped by functional group.
      </para>

      <para>
	&Evolution; provides two kinds of interfaces, public and
	private.  The public interfaces are those designed to be used
	from third-party applications or components; if you wanted to
	write an application that uses &Evolution;'s data repositories
	to display data in a particular way, you would use the public
	interfaces.  The private interfaces are those used inside
	&Evolution; itself; these are generally not interesting unless
	you intend to make modifications to the &Evolution; code base.
      </para>

      <para>
	While the public and private interfaces are described in
	separate reference sections, we have decided to put them
	together in the same book, this guide, because we want to
	encourage you to regard &Evolution; as something more than a
	black box that stores and dispatches personal information.  We
	want you to make modifications to the &Evolution; core if
	these would allow you to present or store your data in better
	ways.  &Evolution; is free software; we want you to learn from
	its design and implementation details so that you can make it
	even better for the whole world to use.
