  <!-- Test that a paint server url(#blahblah) that does not actually point to a paint
       server (linearGradient, radialGradient, pattern) is handled properly.  Here we have
       two rectangles whose "fill" attributes point to a <circle> element, i.e. an invalid
       element type for paint servers.  The first rectangle has a fallback color, and the
       second one doesn't; in this case the first rectangle should be filled with the
       color, and the second one should not be rendered at all.
