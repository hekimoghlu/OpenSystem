Cairo
=====

Perl bindings to the cairo graphics library (http://www.cairographics.org).

INSTALLATION
------------

To install this module type the following:

   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make test
   make install

To avoid installing to a system directory, if you don't have root access,
you can change the installation prefix at Makefile.PL time with

   perl Makefile.PL PREFIX=/some/other/place

This will install the module to the subdirectory lib/perl5 under the given
prefix.  If this is not already in perl's include path, you'll need to tell
perl how to get to this library directory so you can use it; there are three
ways:

  in your environment (the easiest):
    # assuming a bourne-style shell
    PERL5LIB=/some/other/place/lib/perl5/site_perl
    export PERL5LIB

  on the perl command line:
    perl -I /some/other/place/lib/perl5/site_perl yourscript

  in the code of your perl script:
    use lib '/some/other/place/lib/perl5/site_perl';

DEPENDENCIES
------------

BUG REPORTS
-----------
For help with problems, please contact the support forum (above).  If you
already know you have a bug, please file it with one of the bug trackers
below.  With any problems and/or bug reports, it's always helpful for the
developers to have the following information:

- A small script that demonstrates the problem; this is not required, however,
  it will get your issue looked at much faster than a description of the
  problem alone.
- Version of Perl (perl -v)
- Versions of Gtk2-Perl modules (Glib/Gtk2/Pango/Cairo)
- Optional, but nice to have: versions of GTK+ libraries on your system
  (libglib, libgtk+, libpango, libcairo, etc.)

There are multiple project bug trackers, please choose the one you are most
comfortable with using and/or already have an account for.

Request Tracker:
- submitting bugs via the Web (requires a PAUSE account/Bitcard):
  https://rt.cpan.org/Public/Bug/Report.html?Queue=Cairo
- submitting bugs via e-mail (open to anyone with e-mail):
  bug-Cairo [at] rt.cpan.org

Gnome's bugtracker:
- report bugs to the 'perl-cairo' product (requires login)
  https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/perl-cairo/-/issues

PATCH SUBMISSION GUIDELINES
---------------------------
You can send us patches by...
- Creating a Merge Request in GNOME GitLab.
- Those with gnome.org Git ID's can push trivial patches to git directly; if
  you're not sure what a trivial patch is, please ask first in the support
  forum prior to pushing your commit.

OBTAINING SOURCE FROM THE GNOME.ORG GIT REPO
--------------------------------------------
Assuming you already have the 'git' command installed on your system, you can
use the 'git://' protocol:

git clone git://git.gnome.org/perl-Cairo

Or, read-only access via HTTP:

git clone http://git.gnome.org/browse/perl-Cairo

To update an existing clone of the source:

git pull

Most Linux distros package the 'git' command in a package called 'git-core'.
