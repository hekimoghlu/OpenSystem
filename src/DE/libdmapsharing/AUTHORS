A GObject-based DAAP library was first written as a plugin for
Rhythmbox by Charles Schmidt. This work was done as a part of the
2005 Google Summer of Code program. A few other developers, most
notably Jonathan Matthew and William Jon McCann, contributed to the
DAAP plugin after it was integrated into the Rhythmbox project.

Later, Andre Magalhaes expanded Charles' code into a general purpose
DMAP library, libdmapsharing.  This library was used by a product
called Canola and was available on SourceForge. The Canola project
dropped support for DMAP before releasing its second version and
the development of the libdmapsharing library stopped. At this
point, libdmapsharing supported the client side of the DMAP protocol.

W. Michael Petullo pulled the libdmapsharing sources from SourceForge
in December of 2008. He began to add support for the server side of
the DMAP protocol, pulling the latest DAAP sharing code from Rhythmbox
and modifying it to support DPAP. Mike's changes were merged back into
the SourceForge in January of 2009 after he was made a member of the
libdmapsharing development team. The libdmapsharing project was moved
from SourceForge to GNOME Git in August of 2009.

Alexandre Rosenfeld added initial DACP support to libdmapsharing while
working on his 2010 Google Summer of Code project.

Noah Alcantara contributed client-side support for mDNS/DNS-SD on Mac
OS X early in 2011.

The original authors of Rhythmbox's DAAP plugin have endorsed the
re-licensing of their code to LGPL in the following two emails:

	Totally fine by me.  Is there a website or vcs I can look at?

	sure, why not.

	enjoy,

Alexandre Rosenfeld also confirmed that the GPL notice on dacp-player.[ch]
was not intentional:

	Sure, sorry about that, I used a template for that code, it was never my
	intention to make it GPL....

Andre Moreira Magalhaes approved the use of LGPL for test-dmap-client.c.

	Please do it, no problem at all
