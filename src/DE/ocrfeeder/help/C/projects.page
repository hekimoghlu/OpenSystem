<title>Projects</title>

<p>Sometimes a user may want to save the progress of the work
done so far in an image and continue with it later. For this case
<app>OCRFeeder</app> offers the possibility to save and load
projects.</p>

<p>Projects are compressed files with the <em>ocrf</em> extension
which hold information about pages (images) and content areas.</p>

<section id="save">
<title>Saving A Project</title>

<p>After having done some work in an image, a project can be created
by clicking <guiseq><gui>File</gui><gui>Save</gui></guiseq> or
<guiseq><gui>File</gui><gui>Save Asâ€¦</gui></guiseq>. Optionally, the
<keyseq><key>Control</key><key>S</key></keyseq> or
<keyseq><key>Control</key><key>Shift</key><key>S</key></keyseq> keyboard
shortcuts can be used. A file saving dialog will then be shown so the
project's name and location is entered.</p>

<section id="load">
<title>Loading A Project</title>

<p>An existing project can be loaded simply by clicking
<guiseq><gui>File</gui><gui>Open</gui></guiseq> or
<keyseq><key>Control</key><key>O</key></keyseq>.</p>

<section id="append">
<title>Appending A Project</title>

<p>Sometimes it is useful to merge two or more projects in order to create
only one document with the pages of several <app>OCRFeeder</app> projects.
This can be accomplished by appending a project, which simply loads the pages
from a chosen project into the current one. To do this, click in
<guiseq><gui>File</gui><gui>Append Project</gui></guiseq> and choose the
wanted project.</p>

</section>

<section id="clear">
<title>Clearing A Project</title>

<p>If all the information is a project should be deleted (for example,
to start over again), it can be done by choosing
<guiseq><gui>Edit</gui><gui>Clear Project</gui></guiseq>.</p>
