# Ideas for GNOME Application Patterns

 * app with a view switcher (clocks, software)
 * app with a navigation split view (settings, contacts, )
 * app with an overlay sidebar (nautilus etc)
 * app with tabs (g-t-e)
 * app with a plain window (same as now basically)
 * can also add: app with multiple pages (same as the last one but with a nav view and 2 pages set up by default)
