libspelling 0.3.0
=================

This is an unstable release for GNOME 47.beta.

The highlight for this release is a new threaded spellchecking
engine. It performs text analysis and dictionary lookups in
bulk off the UI thread. Care is taken to catch collisions in the
face of user editing while spellchecking operations are in flight.

I expect a significant reduction in initial spellchecking time
after opening a document. Opening `gtktextbuffer.c` in Text Editor
was more than 8x faster.

Currently, libspelling relies on GTK main until 4.15.5 is released
so do keep this in mind if you are a distributor.

Some API has changed, though that is unlikely to affect any known
applications using libspelling.

 * Many new unit tests are part of the testsuite
 * SpellingLanguage was renamed to SpellingDictionary
 * SpellingLanguageInfo was renamed to SpellingLanguage
 * Various helpers were added to SpellingTextBufferAdapter so
   that they can update spelling menus. Applications that update
   the cursor position on clicks before showing menus may want to
   force the menu updating before `menu.popup`.
 * SpellingTextBufferAdapter now uses the new GtkTextBufferCommitNotify
   API in GTK 4.15.5 and newer

libspelling 0.2.1
=================

 * Fix licenses to all be LGPLv2.1+
 * Fix handling of cursor-moved signal

libspelling 0.2.0
=================

This is the first stable release of libspelling, for GNOME 45

While I don't promise that we won't break ABI before 1.0, we do aim
to try for that.
