20 Years of GNOME

* https://www.gimp.org/about/ancient_history.html

  The last paragraph has this:

Remember GTK+? Some developers got the crazy idea that it was a great
toolkit and should be used in everything. And we can create a desktop
based on the toolkit. Like many crazy ideas, this is becoming a
reality. The GNOME project is well underway, in the alpha stages. The
GNOME project is being aggressively supported by Red Hat Labs. All of
this may be seen as a byproduct of GIMP. The success of this one
project has spawned many.

* Sumana says:

<sumanah> Here's the question: who's it for?
<sumanah> Rhetorical triangle: audience, message, and medium.
<sumanah> I think it should be for the community of people who make GNOME, widely construed
<sumanah> users -- users will want, like, a blog post or a "thank you"
msg or something
<sumanah> downstreams and upstreams, OEMs, etc., get a different thankyou etc
<sumanah> but the people who make GNOME, code, translations,
organizers, etc., "this is your story"
<sumanah> a sort of family scrapbook, or like a school yearbook
<sumanah> have an overarching chronological narrative -- sections --
and then within those sections have smaller "sidebar" sections about
people, local communities, efforts
<sumanah> As for reaching out to old contributors, if you tell them
you want to interview them so you can honor their place in GNOME's
heritage in an upcoming anniversary project, that might work

* podcast proposal

Let's use the interviews to create a podcast. The outwards aim of the podcast is to highlight the impact of the GNOME culture in the wider computing industry.

There are many figures who may or may not be still involved in GNOME that played a crucial part and then used their strengths elsewhere in the industry.

The idea is to use the first season to have higher level names that could attract the audience and if successful then on a follow up season we can start
to talk more about contributors who are more well known inwards in the community. The idea is that in the first season, each guest is a well known figure outside of the GNOME ecosystem for work they did afterwards (.NET, Wikipedia...).

If the first season goes well, then we can use that audience to introduce more GNOME-centric guests in a follow up season where we can start to focus on documenting
the history of GNOME.

** Candidates for season 1 (brainstorm):
*** Nat (GitHub)
*** Miguel (.NET/Xamarin)
*** Havoc (tidelift)
*** Vincent Untz (OpenStack/Cloud Foundry)
*** Lennart (systemd)
*** Quim Gil (Wikipedia)
*** Behdad (Chrome/Google, Facebook)
*** Chris Blizzard (Mozilla)

** Candidates for season 2:
*** Calum Benson (Sun)
*** Stormy Peters (HP/ED/Red Hat/Microsoft)
*** Owen Taylor
*** Jonathan Blandford
*** Allan Day
