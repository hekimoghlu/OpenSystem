\chapter{Introduction}

This book is an informal, subjective, incomplete, but hopefully
fascinating history of the \GNOME\ project.

\GNOME\ is one of those old pieces of free software\footnote{``Free
  software'' with ``free as in freedom'', as in software that the GNU
  Project would recommend you use.} that can boast being ubiquitous.
If you use a GNU/Linux system, \GNOME\ very probably came installed
with it by default.  By the Internet's standards for novelty,
\GNOME\ is relatively old software, but it is not ancient.  It is old
like the Eiffel Tower (1889), which isn't ancient, either --- both
still keep being used, renovated, enjoyed, and cursed, all the time,
by people of all kinds.

This book is for, and about, the people who hacked, translated,
documented, beautified, designed, and marketed \GNOME\ into reality.
To all of you, {\bf thank you!}
