1) Introduction
---------------

This document details metacity compliance with the relevent standards.
The format of this document is as follows:

[-/+?] Hint Name/Feature Name (Version number)
       Errata/Comments

The first character indicates the level of compliance as follows:
    -   none
    /   partial
    +   complete
    ?   unknown

The title indicates a feature or a hint in the specification, and the
version number indicates the minimum version of the specification
supported by metacity.  Later versions may be supported if no
incompatible changes have been made in the specification.

2) EWMH Compliance
------------------

The EWMH, or Extended Window Manager Hints is a freedesktop.org-
developed standard to support a number of conventions for
communication between the window manager and clients.  It builds on
and extends the ICCCM (See Section 3).  A copy of the current EWMH
standard is available at http://freedesktop.org/Standards/wm-spec/

  a. Root Window Properties
  -------------------------

+ _NET_SUPPORTED (1.3)

+ _NET_CLIENT_LIST (1.3)

+ _NET_NUMBER_OF_DESKTOPS (1.3)

+ _NET_DESKTOP_GEOMETRY (1.3)
  Metacity does not implement large desktops, so this is kept set to
  the screen size.

+ _NET_DESKTOP_VIEWPORT (1.3)
  Metacity does not implement viewports, so this is a constant (0,0).

+ _NET_CURRENT_DESKTOP (1.3)

+ _NET_DESKTOP_NAMES (1.3)

+ _NET_ACTIVE_WINDOW (1.3)

+ _NET_WORKAREA (1.3)

+ _NET_SUPPORTING_WM_CHECK (1.3)

+ _NET_VIRTUAL_ROOTS (1.3)
  Metacity does not read or set this property, but it does not use
  virtual roots to implement virtual desktops, so it complies with the
  specification.

+ _NET_DESKTOP_LAYOUT (1.3)

+ _NET_SHOWING_DESKTOP (1.3)

  b. Root Window Messages
  -----------------------

+ _NET_CLOSE_WINDOW (1.3)

- _NET_MOVERESIZE_WINDOW (1.3)
  Metacity supports this message, but the specification is unclear on
  the layout of the detail value, and as such it is #if 0'd in the code

+ _NET_WM_MOVERESIZE (1.3)

- _NET_RESTACK_WINDOW (1.3)
  Metacity will raise or lower windows in response to this message,
  but the sibling restack modes are not supported, and it is currently
  #if 0'd in the code.

+ _NET_REQUEST_FRAME_EXTENTS (1.3)  

  c. Application Window Properties
  --------------------------------

+ _NET_WM_NAME (1.3)

+ _NET_WM_VISIBLE_NAME (1.3)
  Metacity does not set this property, but metacity will never display
  a name different from _NET_WM_NAME

+ _NET_WM_ICON_NAME (1.3)

+ _NET_WM_VISIBLE_ICON_NAME (1.3)
  Metacity does not set this property, but metacity will never display
  a name different from _NET_WM_NAME

+ _NET_WM_DESKTOP (1.3)

+ _NET_WM_WINDOW_TYPE (1.3)

/ _NET_WM_STATE (1.3)
  This property is read and updated according to the specification,
  but see caveat below.
  Metacity does not recognize separate vertical and horizontal
  maximization states.  Currently metacity will do a two-dimensional
  maximization if either property is set.
  See: http://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=113601
  Metacity doesn't implement viewports so _NET_WM_STATE_STICKY is
  unimplemented.

+ _NET_WM_ALLOWED_ACTIONS (1.3)
  Metacity keeps this hint up to date.  The code is somewhat crufty
  and should be rewritten, though it is functional.
  See: http://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=90420

+ _NET_WM_STRUT (1.3)

+ _NET_WM_STRUT_PARTIAL (1.3)

+ _NET_WM_ICON_GEOMETRY (1.3)
  Metacity uses this property to draw minimize/restore animations

+ _NET_WM_ICON (1.3)

+ _NET_WM_PID (1.3)

+ _NET_WM_HANDLED_ICONS (1.3)
  Metacity does not read or set this property.  However, metacity
  never manages iconified windows, and so has no need to do so.

+ _NET_WM_USER_TIME (1.3)
  Metacity uses this property to prevent applications from stealing
  focus if supported by the toolkit.

+ _NET_FRAME_EXTENTS (1.3)
  If set in response to a _NET_REQUEST_FRAME_EXTENTS message received
  prior to the window being mapped, this may be an estimate.  This is,
  however, expressly allowed by the specification.

  d. Window Manager Protocols
  ---------------------------
+ _NET_WM_PING (1.3)

3) ICCCM Compliance
