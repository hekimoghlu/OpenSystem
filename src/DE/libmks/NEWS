This is an initial preview release of a new library which provides
"Mouse, Keyboard, and Screen" to Qemu instances.

It communicates using the D-Bus display backend of Qemu.

We expect additional work in the near future such as touchpad, sound,
clipboard, and other integral components when fronting a VM.

Have fun!
