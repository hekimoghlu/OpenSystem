Title: Migrating from GTK 2.x to GTK 4
Slug: gtk-migrating-2-to-4

If your application is still using GTK 2, you should first convert it to GTK 3,
by following the [migration guide](https://docs.gtk.org/gtk3/migrating-2to3.html)
in the GTK 3 documentation, and then follow [the GTK 3 to 4 migration
guide](migrating-3to4.html).
