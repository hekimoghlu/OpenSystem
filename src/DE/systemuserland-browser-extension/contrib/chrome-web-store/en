You MUST install native connector for this extension to work.

For Arch Linux, Debian, Fedora, Gentoo and Ubuntu you can install package named "chrome-gnome-shell".

You also can install connector manually. See https://gnome.pages.gitlab.gnome.org/gnome-browser-integration/pages/installation-guide.html for install instructions.
