This directory contains information to build a MacOSX bundle after having compiled and
installed Libgda and the GdaBrowser tool.

The prerequisites are to have installed GTK+ and associated libraries and
files using the instructions from http://gtk-osx.sourceforge.net
and specifically the BUILD (http://sourceforge.net/apps/trac/gtk-osx/wiki/Build) and
BUNDLE (http://sourceforge.net/apps/trac/gtk-osx/wiki/Bundle) pages.

To create a bundle (GdaBrowser.app) in the build/ directory, use:
./create_bundle.sh

To create a DMG (GdaBrowser.dmg) in the current directory, use:
./create_dmg.sh
