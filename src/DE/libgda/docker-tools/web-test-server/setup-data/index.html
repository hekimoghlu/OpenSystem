    <h1>Libgda's Web provider test server</h1>
    <p>
      This server is a test server for Libgda's "Web" provider, which provides access to databases
      through a HTTP(S) connection.
    </p>
    <p>
      <u>NB:</u>This server does not provide any security, it only serves testing purposes: it implements
      HTTP only (HTTPS would require a certificate which is not easily automated);
      for production environment, <b>NEVER</b> rely on a simple HTTP connection.
    </p>
    <div>
      <h2>Server information</h2>
      <p>
	This instance of the Web provider is configured to allow connections to all of the other database servers
	for which there is a Docker images (ATM: PostgreSQL and MySQL):
	<ul>
	  <li>The global secret is "GdaSecret"</li>
	  <li>Each connection's password is "gdawebuser".</li>
	</ul>
	The <a href="php/gda-tester.php">gda-tester.php</a> page shows all the available connections.
      </p>
      <p>
	<u>NB:</u> if you can't get any connection to work, make sure you have started the corresponding Docker
	containers, and that the host's firewall does not prevent connections.
      </p>
      <p>Also check the <a href="phpinfo.php">phpinfo.php</a> script to see the server's PHP configuration</p>

      <h2>README for the GDA Web provider</h2>
      <p>Unlike most other provider, this provider does not link to a database
	specific library but rather acts as a web client for a web server
	running some PHP scripts which acutally make the web server connect
	to a database.</p>
      
      <p>This provider enables a Libgda application to connect to a database
	which is accessible only behind a web server (as many hosting databases
	are) which can execute some PHP scripts and can connect to the
	database. It is necessary to install some specific PHP scripts on the
	web server which handle the connection and implement the protocol
	described hereafter. Also the PHP interpreter need to be compiled with
	the SimpleXML extension.</p>
