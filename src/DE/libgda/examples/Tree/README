Libgda simple example
=====================

Description:
------------

The example in this directory illustrate how to use a GdaTree to display the database structure
in a hierarchical way:
* a top level node is created for each schema in the database (here there is only the "main" schema)
* below each schema nodes are created for each table in the schema
* a top level node is created for each table visible by default (here all the tables)
* below each node representing a table, nodes are created for each column in the table.
This organization is illustrated in the GdaTree introduction in the documentation.

Compiling and running:
----------------------

To compile (make sure Libgda is installed prior to this):
> make

and to run:
> ./example

Output:
-------
Running should produce the following output:
