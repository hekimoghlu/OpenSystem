LibgdaUI simple example
=======================

Description:
------------

The example in this directory illustrate how to create a simple form using Libgdaui.

It displays a form containing the customers of Libgda's SalesTest database, and for
each customer, displays its ID, its name and the associated sales representative, using
the name of the representative in a combo box rather than the representative's own ID.

The same example.c produces two executables, one for a read-only form (example-ro) and
one for a writeable form (example-rw, depending on the existence of the WRITABLE #define).

Compiling and running:
----------------------

To compile (make sure Libgdaui is installed prior to this):
> make

and to run:
> ./example-ro
> ./example-rw
