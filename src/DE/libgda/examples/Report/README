Libgda Report engine example
============================

Description:
------------

The examples in this directory illustrate the GDA report engine, in the libgda-report component,
part of libgda as of versions >= 4.0.

In these examples the 'SalesTest' (this data source needs to be defined,
which is automatically done when the first Libgda application is run, and uses a small SQLite database)
is used as the source of data to generate a report.

The first example (customers-report.c) takes the "customers-report-spec.xml" XML file which
is a DocBook template (with some <gda_report_...> tags, creates a GdaReportEngine object to "execute" it 
and creates the "customers-report.xml" file (which returns a valid DocBook document).

The second example (customers-report-rml.c) creates a GdaReportRmlDocument object which offers
a higher level than the GdaReportEngine to work on RML files. It loads the "customers-report-rml.rml"
RML file, and generates a PDF file from it.

The 3rd example (schema-report.c) takes the "schema-report-spec.xml" XML file and created the "schema-report.xml"
file (a valid DocBook document) which lists all the database schemas, the tables and views in the default schema
along with their properties.

Compiling and running:
----------------------

To compile (make sure Libgda is installed prior to this):
> make

and to run:
> ./customers-report

result is in the customers-report.xml file, which can be converted to HTML (in a customers-report.html file) as:
> make html
(make sure you set the correct path to the stylesheet in the Makefile)
> firefox customers-report.html


or, for the second example:
> ./customers-report-rml
> evince customers-report-rml.pdf

and for the 3rd:
> ./schema-report
> make schema-html
(make sure you set the correct path to the stylesheet in the Makefile)
> firefox schema-report.html
