LibgdaUI simple custom plugin
=============================

Description:
------------

The example in this directory illustrate how to create a simple custom data entry plugin.

The custom data entry is a password entry which replaces any entered character with a
generic '*' character and allows one to set the minimum length.

The compilation creates a "custom-plugin.so" file. This file, along with the XML file containing
the plugin options need to be copied to LibgdaUI's plugins directory, which can be queried
using the pkg-config program as:
> pkg-config --variable=pluginsdir libgda-ui-5.0

Compiling and running:
----------------------

To compile (make sure Libgdaui is installed prior to this):
> make
> make install

The plugin will now automatically be loaded at runtime and useable.

> make uninstall
