Libgda table copy examples
==========================

Description:
------------

The examples in this directory illustrate how to copy data from one table to
another (limited to 10 rows) in another database. 

The examples copy the table "products"'s contents of the 'SalesTest' (this data source needs to be defined, 
which is automatically done when the first Libgda application is run, and uses a small SQLite database), to
another database created for that purpose, in a table called "products_copied<x>" where <x> varies from 1 to 3. 

So all the examples start with the same steps:

* open a source connection to the 'SalesTest' data source
* open a destination connection to a local SQLite database (SQLite is chosen to make the examples exectable
  without the need of a database server, but the same code could be applied with any kind of database
  supported by Libgda).

The "table-copy.c" file shows 2 ways to do it, both start by getting a data model
containing all the data to copy, and:
* in the 1st method, an INSERT query is created with place holders for the values to
  insert, and this query is executed for each row in the source data model (binding the
  parameters each time) - the price of the products is increased by 5% in the process
* in the 2nd method, a GdaDataSelect is created and gda_data_model_import_from_model()
  is called to actually do the data copy

The "table-copy-easier.c" file shows an easier way using virtual connections: the two opened connections are
added to a virtual connection using the "source" and "destination" namespaces; then 
an "INSERT INTO destination.products_copied3 SELECT ref, name, price, wh_stored FROM source.products" is executed.

Compiling and running:
----------------------

To compile (make sure Libgda is installed prior to this):
> make

and to run:
> ./table-copy
> ./table-copy-easier

After executing either of these programs, there should be a "copy.db" file containing
the copied data.
