libgda's examples
-----------------

The objective here is to give to the
developer using libgda quick examples in order she
could use as soon as possible the technology.

Currently the contents are:
* in SimpleExample/: a very simple example to start with
* in BDB/: using the GdaDataModelBdb data model and how to subclass it
* in DirDataModel/: using the GdaDataModelDir object
* in F-Spot/: and example of F-Spot database repair tool (using virtual connections)
* in TableCopy/: examples of how to copy table data
* in Virtual/: virtual connection usage example
* in Report/: reports examples
* in XSLT/: example using Libgda's extension to libxslt
* in DDL/: example using the GdaServerOperation object to perform a CREATE TABLE query
* in SqlParserConsole/: simple console to test how the GdaSqlParser object parses strings
* in MetaStore/: simple example to show how to use and update a GdaMetaStore
* in Tree/: simple example to show how to use the GdaTree object
* in SqlBuilder: simple example to show how to use GdaSqlBuilder object to build various statements
* in AsyncExec: simple example illustrating how to perform asynchronous statement execution
* in WritableSelect/: example to show how to modify a GdaDataModel returned after
  the execution of a SELECT statement
* in Git/: JavaScript example to use the GObject introspection with Libgda

And using the UI extension:
* in SimpleUIForm/: a very simple form, with read-only and read-write versions

Good luck and happy hacking!
