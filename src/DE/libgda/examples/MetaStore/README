Libgda simple example
=====================

Description:
------------

The example in this directory illustrate how to get meta data information (information about
the database's objects). There are 2 examples.

example.c:
----------
The following is done:
* display columns of the 'customers' table, there should be none as the meta data has not been
  yet updated
* update the meta data for the 'customers' table, and show the columns now
* update the meta data for all the tables, and this time show the columns of the 'products' table

background.c:
-------------
This example executes a complete meta data update in the background (in a sub thread) using
the GdaThreadWrapper object, while it displays some messages.
