Libgda Virtual library example
==============================

Description:
------------

This example illustrates the libgda-virtual component,
part of libgda as of versions >= 3.2.

In this example, a GdaVirtualConnection object is created to be able to use SQL
on the contents of GdaDataModel objects. For this purpose, a GdaVproviderDataModel
object is created, which itself creates a GdaVconnectionDataModel connection.

Then the city.csv and country.csv CSV files are loaded into GdaDataModel objects,
and added to that virtual connection. Another GdaDataModelArray object is created
which will be populated by a SQL statement, and also added to the connection.

If these steps are complete, then an "INSERT INTO ... SELECT ..." statement is run,
and the resulting data model is itself exported to a CSV file named 'results.csv'

Compiling and running:
----------------------

To compile (make sure Libgda is installed prior to this):
> make

and to run:
> ./virtual-test
> cat results.csv
