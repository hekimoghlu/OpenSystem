Libgda SQL parser console
=========================

Description:
------------

The example in this directory illustrate how the GdaSqlParser object parses strings; it allows one
to enter SQL statements (on one line) and reports how the string has been parsed.

The default output mode is to display the contents of each GdaSqlStatement structure created
by the parser using a JSON syntax, and the alternative mode is to create ".dot" files
to represent them using the GraphViz tool (http://graphviz.org/).

Compiling and running:
----------------------

To compile (make sure Libgda is installed prior to this):
> make

and to run:
> ./console

To switch to graph output mode, enter the "\graph" command. Each parsed statement will 
then be saved as a "statement-XYZ.dot" file, which is converted to png or svg using:

> make png
> make svg
