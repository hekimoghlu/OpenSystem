  <h1>Introduction</h1>
  <p>
    This notice briefly explains the structure of the JDBC provider as it is more complicated than
    the usual database providers.
  </p>
  <p>
    The JDBC provider uses the Java Native Interface (JNI) to run a Java Virtual Machine (JVM) which
    itself is responsible for accessing the database using the JDBC API (java.sql.* classes) and
    a JDBC driver.
  </p>
  <p>
    For each available JDBC driver, the JDBC provider will create a specific provider named after
    the JDBC driver name. For example the <link href="http://www.h2database.com">H2 database</link> driver
    being named "org.h2.Driver", the corresponding GDA provider will also be named "org.h2.Driver".
  </p>
  <p>
    The <b>gda-list-jdbc-providers-4.0</b> program can be used to list all the usable JDBC drivers
    found:<br/>
    <pre>
[]> gda-list-jdbc-providers-4.0
Usable JDBC drivers:
org.h2.Driver
sun.jdbc.odbc.JdbcOdbcDriver
    </pre>
    Using the GDA SQL console, the list of database providers is then:<br/>
    <pre>
gda> .lp
                                         Installed providers list

    Currently the only named parameter to define a DSN or to open a connection is the connection's URL as
    defined by the JDBC driver, for example "URL=jdbc:h2:/path/to/h2file" for the H2 database. Opening a
    connection using the GDA SQL console can be done as:
    <pre>
      []> gda-sql-4.0 org.h2.Driver://URL=jdbc:h2:/path/to/h2file
    </pre>
  </p>

  <h1>Provider's structure</h1>
  <p>
    The following figure illustrates the provider's structure: the provider's corresponding shared
    library is the "libgda-jdbc.so" file (or "libgda-jdbc.dll" for Windows). This shared library
    does not depend on the Java's virtual machine library ("libjvm.dll") but this library is loaded
    when the provider is initialized.
  </p>
  <p>
    Once the Java's virtual machine library is loaded, the JAVA code specific to the JDBC provider
    (the "gdaprovider-4.0.jar" file) and the various JDBC drivers (as .jar files) are loaded by the JVM.
  </p>
  <p>
    The JAVA code specific to the JDBC provider (the "*.java" files) implements some classes
    instantiated and used by the C code through JNI. This code itself uses some native C methods
    through JNI which are implemented by the "Gda*.c" files (the "Gda*.h" files being generated
    by JNI tools).
  </p>
  <p>
    <img src="structure.png"/>
  </p>
  <p>
    The "jni-globals.h" file declares all the JAVA object identifiers used by the C code which are
    initialized when the corresponding JAVA classes are loaded by the JVM (in the "*initIDs()" methods).
  </p>
  <p>
    The "jni-wrapper.h" and "jni-wrapper.c" files implement some small utility library to wrap some
    common (but not all) calls to JNI.
