If nobody has reported this issue yet, please provide the details below.


Please describe the issue you’re experiencing:
…


What Linux distribution are you using, and what kind of package (RPM, deb, flatpak, etc.) are you experiencing the problem with?


Please attach a log of the issue, by running the following commands, reproducing the issue, and then attaching `gnome-software.log` here:

pkill gnome-software
