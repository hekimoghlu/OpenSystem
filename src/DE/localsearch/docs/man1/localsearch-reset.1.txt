localsearch-reset(1)
====================

== NAME

localsearch-reset - Erase the indexed data

== SYNOPSIS

*localsearch reset* [--filesystem] [--file _FILE_]

== DESCRIPTION

The reset command will change either your configuration or index
irreversibly and should be used with care. Other than tags, actual data
(e.g. files) should not be affected by this command.

The "index" is a link between your content (either locally or remotely)
and how it can be found quickly using a number of different queries.
Under the hood, this is done using a database.

Removing all data and starting again from the beginning with an empty
data set (which is a common use of this command) will make LocalSearch
behave as if it was just installed.

== OPTIONS

*-s, --filesystem*::
  Removes indexed filesystem data. The indexer will automatically re-create
  its cache from the filesystem when it restarts. This option is the default
  if no arguments are given.
*-f, --file _FILE_*::
  Resets all indexed information about _FILE_, works recursively for
  directories. Nothing will be done if _FILE_ is not currently indexed.
  After deletion, a request to reindex this data will be immediately
  issued.
