localsearch-info(1)
===================

== NAME

localsearch-info - Retrieve information available for files and resources.

== SYNOPSIS

*localsearch info* [_options_...] <__file1__> [[_file2_] ...]

== DESCRIPTION

*localsearch info* asks for all the known metadata available for the given
_file_.

Multiple _file_ arguments can be provided to retrieve information about
multiple files.

The _file_ argument can be either a local path or a URI. It also does
not have to be an absolute path.

== OPTIONS

*-f, --full-namespaces*::
  By default, all keys and values reported about any given _file_ are
  returned in shortened form, for example, _nie:title_ is shown instead
  of _http://tracker.api.gnome.org/ontology/v3/nie#title_.
  This makes things much easier to see generally and the output is less
  cluttered. This option reverses that so FULL namespaces are shown
  instead.
*-c, --plain-text-content*::
  If the resource being displayed has nie:PlainTextContent (i.e.
  information about the content of the resource, which could be the
  contents of a file on the disk), then this option displays that in the
  output.
*-o, --output-format=<__FORMAT__>*::
  Choose which format to use to output results. Supported formats are
  _turtle_, _trig_ and _json-ld_.
*-e, --eligible=<__FILE__>*::
  Checks whether a file is eligible for indexing. There might be a number
  of factors why it is not, e.g. being in a non-indexed folder, via
  configuration or filters.
