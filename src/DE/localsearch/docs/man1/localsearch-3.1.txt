localsearch-3(1)
================

== NAME

localsearch-3 - Filesystem indexer.

== SYNOPSIS

*localsearch-3* [_OPTION_...]

== DESCRIPTION

*localsearch-3* is not supposed to be run by the user since it is
started by systemd when the user logs in. Of course, it can also be
started manually for debugging purposes. You can not run more than one
instance of this at the same time.

*localsearch-3* mines information about applications and files only.

== OPTIONS

*-?, --help*::
  Show summary of options.
*-V, --version*::
  Returns the version of this binary.
*-n, --no-daemon*::
  Tells the indexer to exit once all indexing has finished and the
  database is up to date. This is not the default mode of operation for
  the indexer, usually it stays around acting like a daemon to monitor
  file updates which may occur over time. This option renders the
  *--initial-sleep* option moot.
*-e, --eligible=FILE*::
  Checks if *FILE* is eligible for being mined based on the current
  configuration rules. In addition to this, it will check if *FILE*
  would be monitored for changes. This works with non-existing *FILE*
  arguments as well as existing *FILE* arguments.

== DESKTOP INTEGRATION

Desktop environments that make use of localsearch-3 should start the
*localsearch-3.service* user unit on startup. For instance, sessions
managed by gnome-session can add this service as a *Wants=* dependency
in their *gnome-session@name.target.d/session.conf* drop-in.

This allows sessions to disable background filesystem indexing (by simply
not starting *localsearch-3.service*) in situations where it's not necessary
(i.e. special kiosk sessions)
