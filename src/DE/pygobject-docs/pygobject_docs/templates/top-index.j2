GNOME Python API documentation
==============================

{% if gnome_version %}
GNOME version: {{ gnome_version }}
{% endif %}

Also known as: `PyGObject <https://pygobject.gnome.org>`_ API docs.

This site contains documentation for the latest release of the GNOME libraries: GTK 4, LibAdwaita, etc.
The documentation is organized by library. Each library has its own page,
which lists all the classes, functions, and other objects in that library.

The documentation is generated from the actual API, as exposed by PyGObject.

The API for the PyGObject library itself (:mod:`gi`) is documented in the `PyGObject User Guide <https://pygobject.gnome.org/guide>`_.

.. note::

   The documentation is derived from the official C-based API's. This means that the documentation can contain
   C-specific wording. Code examples are not translated to Python.
   In general that should not be a problem, since the mapping from C to Python is pretty straightforward.

If you find an inconsistency in the API docs, please `create an issue <https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/pygobject-docs/-/issues>`_.
