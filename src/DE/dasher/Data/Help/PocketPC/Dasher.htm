<b>Writing with Dasher</b>

<ul>
<LI>To open Dasher, tap <img src="flag.2bp">&nbsp; > <b>Programs</b> > <b>Dasher</b>.
<li>Initially, the characters appear in boxes in a vertical column on the right hand side (figure 1). 
<li>Start by pressing the stylus on the centre and move towards the first letter you want to write. eg. 't'.</ul>

<p><center><img src="dasher1.b2p"><br>Figure 1: Initial configuration.</center><ul>

<li> The display will start to zoom in towards the 't' (figure 2).</ul>

<p><center><img src="dasher2.b2p"><br>Figure 2: Writing 't'.</center><ul>

<li>You can stop at any time by lifting the stylus. 
<li>The horizontal direction controls the rate of zooming in. Moving the stylus to the right zooms in. Moving the stylus to the left zooms out. The vertical determines the place which is being zoomed in on.  <li>As the desired letter moves towards the crosshair, further letters can be selected by searching within the box of the previous letter. In figure 3, 'h' is being selected. </ul><p><center><img src="dasher3.b2p">
<br>Figure 3: Writing 't' followed by 'h'.</center>
<ul>
<li>Always look inside the current letter for the next letter. For example, to write 'the', point at the 'e' within 'h' (figure 4), and not the 'e' within 't' (figure 5).
</ul>

<p><a name="copy"></a><b>Copying text to other applications</b>

<ul><li>Select the text by dragging with the stylus. Tap <b>Edit > Copy</b> to paste to the clipboard. </ul><P>&nbsp;<!-- PegHelp --><hr><!-- *****Topic Break**** --><p><a name="training"></a><b>Training texts</b></p><ul><li>Dasher uses a language model, trained on two pieces of text. <li>The first is /Program Files/Dasher/source.txt which is installed with Dasher.<li>The second is /My Documents/Dasher.txt. As you write with Dasher, the text is appended to the file. Therefore, repeated use of Dasher will improve the langauage model and also writing speed.</ul>
