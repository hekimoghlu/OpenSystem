Dasher Release Instructions
---------------------------

How to make a Dasher release. Note that most of this only makes sense
if you're the Dasher maintainer, i.e., me!:

1. Check that Dasher builds!

2. Check that alphabet, colour and training files are up-to-date. Use
   the scripts in /Utils/Linux/Packaging to help.

3. Create $(top_srcdir)/.tarball-version containing the release version
   number.

4. Check that verion numbers are up to date. The following places
   contain version numbers:
   
   a) Win32 resources file (Src/Win32/Dasher.rc) - both in the 'about' dialogue box and in
   the version information structure.

   b) README

   c) WiX installer definition files:
     - Src/Installer/Dasher.wxs
	 - Src/InstallerW2K/Dasher.wxs (Windows 2K compatibility version)
	 - Src/InstallerTobii/Dasher.wxs (MyTobii customised installer)
     - Src/Installer*/Installer*.wixproj

4. Add an item to the ChangeLog and NEWS files

5. Add list of changes to the README file

6. Rebuild the Makefiles

7. Run make distcheck. Fix anything that is broken, and repeat until
   it works.

8. Copy the tarball to a Windows machine, build 'Release',
   check it works.

9. Build Windows installer package(s).

10. Commit to repository and tag with release.

11. Bump version numbers, commit to repository again.

12. Copy everything to download website.

13. Upload tarball to GNOME servers and install.

14. Send announcement email
