Tilt Sensors
============

We have a DLP-TILT module, which is a cheap, fairly low resolution
sensor with a built in USB<->serial adaptor:

We also have a little black box from Maplin to put it in, and a 3m USB
cable.

The Linux driver is ftdi_sio, which is shipped with modern kernels,
but there's some (not great) documentation here:

http://ftdi-usb-sio.sourceforge.net/

You need to specify the USB vendor/product codes to the driver:

modprobe ftdi_sio vendor=0x0403 product=0xfbfa

Having done that, devfs should do it's stuff. Compile Dasher with tilt
support, and for best results select start on mouse position, control
mode (for stopping) and possibly 1D mode, and you should be away.
