Slug: release-7.2.1

## Changes

- Use new connector name to make sure that coming on Jan 4, 2017 version 8 update will not break existing users.

## Known issues

- Version 7.2.1 source tarball is not published at ftp. Look to [git branch "release/v7.2"](https://git.gnome.org/browse/chrome-gnome-shell/log/?h=release/v7.2) for source code.
- Native host connector is not working in Google Chrome when installed via Debian Sid repository or Ubuntu 16.10 Universe repository. To know "why?" look [here](https://github.com/nE0sIghT/chrome-gnome-shell-mirror/issues/17), [here](https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=840804) and [here](https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=840235). For a workaround look [here](https://wiki.gnome.org/Projects/GnomeShellIntegrationForChrome/Installation#Troubleshooting).
- Web extension is broken on FreeBSD because of [bug 212925](https://bugs.freebsd.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=212925).
