Slug: release-10.0.1

This is bugfix release intended for Firefox ESR 52 only.

## Changes

- Disabled GNOME Shell extensions synchronization. Firefox 52 does not support all relevant APIs yet.

## Known issues

- Version 10.0.1 source tarball is not published at ftp. Look to [git branch "release/v10.0.1"](https://git.gnome.org/browse/chrome-gnome-shell/log/?h=release/v10.0.1) for source code.
- Firefox can consume a lot of CPU and sometime crash on quit because of [Mozilla's bug 1349874](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1349874).
