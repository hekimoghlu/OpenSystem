# cloudproviders integration API

libcloudproviders is a DBus API that allows cloud storage sync clients to expose
their services. Clients such as file managers and desktop environments can then
provide integrated access to the cloud providers services.

More information on its uses in [this blog post](https://csorianognome.wordpress.com/2015/07/07/cloud-providers/).
