/*  -- LAPACK auxiliary routine (version 2.0) --   
       Univ. of Tennessee, Univ. of California Berkeley, NAG Ltd.,   
       Courant Institute, Argonne National Lab, and Rice University   
       September 30, 1994   


    Purpose   
    =======   

    XERBLA  is an error handler for the LAPACK routines.   
    It is called by an LAPACK routine if an input parameter has an   
    invalid value.  A message is printed and execution stops.   

    Installers may consider modifying the STOP statement in order to   
    call system-specific exception-handling facilities.   

    Arguments   
    =========   

    SRNAME  (input) CHARACTER*6   
            The name of the routine which called XERBLA.   

    INFO    (input) INT   
            The position of the invalid parameter in the parameter list   

            of the calling routine.   

   =====================================================================
