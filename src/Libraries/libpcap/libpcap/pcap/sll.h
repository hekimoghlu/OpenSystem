/*
 * For captures on Linux cooked sockets, we construct a fake header
 * that includes:
 *
 *	a 2-byte "packet type" which is one of:
 *
 *		LINUX_SLL_HOST		packet was sent to us
 *		LINUX_SLL_BROADCAST	packet was broadcast
 *		LINUX_SLL_MULTICAST	packet was multicast
 *		LINUX_SLL_OTHERHOST	packet was sent to somebody else
 *		LINUX_SLL_OUTGOING	packet was sent *by* us;
 *
 *	a 2-byte Ethernet protocol field;
 *
 *	a 2-byte link-layer type;
 *
 *	a 2-byte link-layer address length;
 *
 *	an 8-byte source link-layer address, whose actual length is
 *	specified by the previous value.
 *
 * All fields except for the link-layer address are in network byte order.
 *
 * DO NOT change the layout of this structure, or change any of the
 * LINUX_SLL_ values below.  If you must change the link-layer header
 * for a "cooked" Linux capture, introduce a new DLT_ type (ask
 * "tcpdump-workers@lists.tcpdump.org" for one, so that you don't give it
 * a value that collides with a value already being used), and use the
 * new header in captures of that type, so that programs that can
 * handle DLT_LINUX_SLL captures will continue to handle them correctly
 * without any change, and so that capture files with different headers
 * can be told apart and programs that read them can dissect the
 * packets in them.
