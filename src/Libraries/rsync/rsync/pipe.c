/**
 * Create a child connected to us via its stdin/stdout.
 *
 * This is derived from CVS code
 *
 * Note that in the child STDIN is set to blocking and STDOUT
 * is set to non-blocking. This is necessary as rsh relies on stdin being blocking
 *  and ssh relies on stdout being non-blocking
 *
 * If blocking_io is set then use blocking io on both fds. That can be
 * used to cope with badly broken rsh implementations like the one on
 * Solaris.

 * (writing to the parent).  Since that's four socket ends, each
 * process has to close the two ends it doesn't need.  The remaining
 * two socket ends are retained for reading and writing.  In the
 * child, the STDIN and STDOUT file descriptors refer to these
 * sockets.  In the parent, the function arguments f_in and f_out are
