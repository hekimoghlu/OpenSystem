// Register numbers used in bytecode operations have different meaning according to their ranges:
//      0x80000000-0xFFFFFFFF  Negative indices from the CallFrame pointer are entries in the call frame.
//      0x00000000-0x3FFFFFFF  Forwards indices from the CallFrame pointer are local vars and temporaries with the function's callframe.
//      0x40000000-0x7FFFFFFF  Positive indices from 0x40000000 specify entries in the constant pool on the CodeBlock.

static constexpr int FirstConstantRegisterIndex8 = 16;
static constexpr int FirstConstantRegisterIndex16 = 64;
