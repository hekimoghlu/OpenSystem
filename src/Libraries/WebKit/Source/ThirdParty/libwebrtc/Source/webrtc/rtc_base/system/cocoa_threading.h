// If Cocoa is to be used on more than one thread, it must know that the
// application is multithreaded.  Since it's possible to enter Cocoa code
// from threads created by pthread_thread_create, Cocoa won't necessarily
// be aware that the application is multithreaded.  Spawning an NSThread is
// enough to get Cocoa to set up for multithreaded operation, so this is done
// if necessary before pthread_thread_create spawns any threads.
