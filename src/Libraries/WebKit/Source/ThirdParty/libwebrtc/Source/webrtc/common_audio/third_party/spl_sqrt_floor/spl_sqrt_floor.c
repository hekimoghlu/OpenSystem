// Minor modifications in code style for WebRTC, 2012.

#include "common_audio/third_party/spl_sqrt_floor/spl_sqrt_floor.h"

/*
 * Algorithm:
 * Successive approximation of the equation (root + delta) ^ 2 = N
 * until delta < 1. If delta < 1 we have the integer part of SQRT (N).
 * Use delta = 2^i for i = 15 .. 0.
 *
 * Output precision is 16 bits. Note for large input values (close to
 * 0x7FFFFFFF), bit 15 (the highest bit of the low 16-bit half word)
 * contains the MSB information (a non-sign value). Do with caution
 * if you need to cast the output to int16_t type.
 *
 * If the input value is negative, it returns 0.
