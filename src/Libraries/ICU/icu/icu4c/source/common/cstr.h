/**
 * ICU-internal class CStr, a small helper class to facilitate passing UnicodeStrings
 * to functions needing (const char *) strings, such as printf().
 *
 * It is intended primarily for use in debugging or in tests. Uses platform 
 * default code page conversion, which will do the best job possible,
 * but may be lossy, depending on the platform.
 *
 * If no other conversion is available, use invariant conversion and substitute
 * '?' for non-invariant characters.
 *
 * Example Usage:
 *   UnicodeString s = whatever;
 *   printf("%s", CStr(s)());
 *
 *   The explicit call to the CStr() constructor creates a temporary object.
 *   Operator () on the temporary object returns a (const char *) pointer.
 *   The lifetime of the (const char *) data is that of the temporary object,
 *   which works well when passing it as a parameter to another function, such as printf.
