///     selected in an editor, or to all switches in a project when an enum
///     constant is added to an enum.
///   - tool vs editor: some refactoring operation can be initiated in the
///     editor when a declaration is selected, or in a tool when the name of
///     the declaration is passed using a command-line argument.
