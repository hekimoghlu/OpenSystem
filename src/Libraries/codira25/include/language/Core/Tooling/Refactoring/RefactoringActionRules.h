/// Creates a new refactoring action rule that constructs and invokes the

///
/// This function takes in a list of values whose type derives from
/// \c RefactoringActionRuleRequirement. These values describe the initiation
/// requirements that have to be satisfied by the refactoring engine before
/// the provided action rule can be constructed and invoked. The engine
/// verifies that the requirements are satisfied by evaluating them (using the
/// 'evaluate' member function) and checking that the results don't contain
/// any errors. Once all requirements are satisfied, the provided refactoring
/// rule is constructed by passing in the values returned by the requirements'
/// evaluate functions as arguments to the constructor. The rule is then invoked
/// immediately after construction.
///
/// The separation of requirements, their evaluation and the invocation of the
/// refactoring action rule allows the refactoring clients to:
///   - Disable refactoring action rules whose requirements are not supported.
///   - Gather the set of options and define a command-line / visual interface
///     that allows users to input these options without ever invoking the
///     action.
