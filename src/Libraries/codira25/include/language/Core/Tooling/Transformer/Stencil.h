/// This file defines the *Stencil* abstraction: a code-generating object,
/// parameterized by named references to (bound) AST nodes.  Given a match
/// result, a stencil can be evaluated to a string of source code.
///
/// A stencil is similar in spirit to a format string: it is composed of a
/// series of raw text strings, references to nodes (the parameters) and helper
/// code-generation operations.
