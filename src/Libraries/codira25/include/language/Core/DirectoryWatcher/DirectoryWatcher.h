/// Invokes client-provided function on every filesystem event in the watched
/// directory. Initially the watched directory is scanned and for every file
/// found, an event is synthesized as if the file was added.
///
/// This is not a general purpose directory monitoring tool - list of
/// limitations follows.
///
/// Only flat directories with no subdirectories are supported. In case
/// subdirectories are present the behavior is unspecified - events *might* be
/// passed to Receiver on macOS (due to FSEvents being used) while they
/// *probably* won't be passed on Linux (due to inotify being used).
///
/// Known potential inconsistencies
/// - For files that are deleted befor the initial scan processed them, clients
/// might receive Removed notification without any prior Added notification.
/// - Multiple notifications might be produced when a file is added to the
/// watched directory during the initial scan. We are choosing the lesser evil
/// here as the only known alternative strategy would be to invalidate the
/// watcher instance and force user to create a new one whenever filesystem
/// event occurs during the initial scan but that would introduce continuous
/// restarting failure mode (watched directory is not always "owned" by the same
/// process that is consuming it). Since existing clients can handle duplicate
/// events well, we decided for simplicity.
///
/// Notifications are provided only for changes done through local user-space
/// filesystem interface. Specifically, it's unspecified if notification would
/// be provided in case of a:
/// - a file mmap-ed and changed
/// - a file changed via remote (NFS) or virtual (/proc) FS access to monitored
/// directory
/// - another filesystem mounted to the watched directory
///
/// No support for LLVM VFS.
///
/// It is unspecified whether notifications for files being deleted are sent in
/// case the whole watched directory is sent.
///
/// Directories containing "too many" files and/or receiving events "too
/// frequently" are not supported - if the initial scan can't be finished before
/// the watcher instance gets invalidated (see WatcherGotInvalidated) there's no
/// good error handling strategy - the only option for client is to destroy the
/// watcher, restart watching with new instance and hope it won't repeat.
