/// \file
/// This header contains the declarations of functions which are used to decide
/// which loops should be completely unrolled and mark their corresponding
/// CFGBlocks. It is done by tracking a stack of loops in the ProgramState. This
/// way specific loops can be marked as completely unrolled. For considering a
/// loop to be completely unrolled it has to fulfill the following requirements:
/// - Currently only forStmts can be considered.
/// - The bound has to be known.
/// - The counter variable has not escaped before/in the body of the loop and
///   changed only in the increment statement corresponding to the loop. It also
///   has to be initialized by a literal in the corresponding initStmt.
/// - Does not contain goto, switch and returnStmt.
