/// saved value.

/// Example of schedules and run, and what they mean:
///  Fortran: forall (i=i:10) x(i) = y(i)
///
///  hlfir.forall lb { hlfir.yield %c1} ub { hlfir.yield %c10} do {
///   ^bb1(%i: index)
///     hlfir.region_assign {
///        %yi_addr = hlfir.designate %y(%i)
///        %yi = fir.load %yi_addr
///        hlfir.yield %yi
///     } to {
///        %xi = hlfir.designate %x(%i)
///        hlfir.yield %xi
///     }
///  }
///
///  If the scheduling analysis cannot prove that %x and %y do not overlap, it
///  will generate 2 runs for the schdule. The first containing
///  SaveEntity{rhs_region}, and the second one containing the
///  hlfir.region_assign.
///
///  The lowering of that schedule will have to:
///  For the first run:
///   1. create a temporary to contain all the %yi for all %i
///   2. create a loop nest for the forall, evaluate the %yi and save them
///   inside the loop, but do not evaluate the LHS or assignment.
///   For the second run:
///   3. create a loop nest again for the forall, evaluate the LHS, get the
///   saved %yi, and evaluate %yi to %xi. After all runs:
///   4. clean the temporary for the %yi.
///
/// If the scheduling analysis can prove %x and %y do not overlap, it will
/// generate only one run with the hlfir.region_assign, which will be
/// implemented as a single loop that evaluate %xi, %yi and does %xi = %yi in
/// the loop body.

/// Core function that analyzes an ordered assignment tree and builds a
/// schedule for its evaluation.
/// The main goal of the scheduler is to avoid creating temporary storage
/// (required for SaveEntity). But it can optionally be asked to fuse Forall
/// and Where assignments in the same loop nests when possible since it has the
/// memory effects analysis at hand.
