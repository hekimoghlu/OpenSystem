/// Record with information about how a bitfield should be accessed. This is
/// very similar to what LLVM codegen does, once CIR evolves it's possible we
/// can use a more higher level representation.
///
/// Often we lay out a sequence of bitfields as a contiguous sequence of bits.
/// When the AST record layout does this, we represent it in CIR as a
/// `!cir.record` type, which directly reflects the structure's layout,
/// including bitfield packing and padding, using CIR types such as
/// `!cir.bool`, `!s8i`, `!u16i`.
///
/// To access a particular bitfield in CIR, we use the operations
/// `cir.get_bitfield` (`GetBitfieldOp`) or `cir.set_bitfield`
/// (`SetBitfieldOp`). These operations rely on the `bitfield_info`
/// attribute, which provides detailed metadata required for access,
/// such as the size and offset of the bitfield, the type and size of
/// the underlying storage, and whether the value is signed.
/// The CIRGenRecordLayout also has a bitFields map which encodes which
/// byte-sequence this bitfield falls within. Let's assume the following C
/// struct:
///
///   struct S {
///     char a, b, c;
///     unsigned bits : 3;
///     unsigned more_bits : 4;
///     unsigned still_more_bits : 7;
///   };
///
/// This will end up as the following cir.record. The bitfield members are
/// represented by one !u16i value, and the array provides padding to align the
/// struct to a 4-byte alignment.
///
///   !rec_S = !cir.record<struct "S" padded {!s8i, !s8i, !s8i, !u16i,
///   !cir.array<!u8i x 3>}>
///
/// When generating code to access more_bits, we'll generate something
/// essentially like this:
///
///   #bfi_more_bits = #cir.bitfield_info<name = "more_bits", storage_type =
///   !u16i, size = 4, offset = 3, is_signed = false>
///
///   cir.func @store_field() {
///     %0 = cir.alloca !rec_S, !cir.ptr<!rec_S>, ["s"] {alignment = 4 : i64}
///     %1 = cir.const #cir.int<2> : !s32i
///     %2 = cir.cast(integral, %1 : !s32i), !u32i
///     %3 = cir.get_member %0[3] {name = "more_bits"} : !cir.ptr<!rec_S> ->
///     !cir.ptr<!u16i>
///     %4 = cir.set_bitfield(#bfi_more_bits, %3 :
///     !cir.ptr<!u16i>, %2 : !u32i) -> !u32i
///     cir.return
