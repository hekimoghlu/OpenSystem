#ifndef NO_WARN_X86_INTRINSICS
/* This header is distributed to simplify porting x86_64 code that
   makes explicit use of Intel intrinsics to powerpc64le.
   It is the user's responsibility to determine if the results are
   acceptable and make additional changes as necessary.
   Note that much code that uses Intel intrinsics can be rewritten in
   standard C or GNU C extensions, which are more portable and better
   optimized across multiple targets.  */
