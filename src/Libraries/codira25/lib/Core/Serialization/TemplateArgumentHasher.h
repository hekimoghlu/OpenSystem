/// argument should have the same (invented) spelling in every translation
/// unit, but it is not sure that's true in all cases. There may still be cases
/// where the canonical type includes some aspect of "whatever we saw first",
/// in which case the ODR hash can differ across translation units for
/// non-dependent, canonical template arguments that are spelled differently
/// but have the same meaning. But it is not easy to raise examples.
