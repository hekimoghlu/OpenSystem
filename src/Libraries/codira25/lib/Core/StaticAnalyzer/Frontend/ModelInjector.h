/// \file
/// This file defines the language::Core::ento::ModelInjector class which implements the
/// language::Core::CodeInjector interface. This class is responsible for injecting
/// function definitions that were synthesized from model files.
///
/// Model files allow definitions of functions to be lazily constituted for functions
/// which lack bodies in the original source code.  This allows the analyzer
/// to more precisely analyze code that calls such functions, analyzing the
/// artificial definitions (which typically approximate the semantics of the
/// called function) when called by client code.  These definitions are
/// reconstituted lazily, on-demand, by the static analyzer engine.
