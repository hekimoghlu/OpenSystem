/// Request from the client to the server to wait for SourceKit-LSP to handle all ongoing requests and, optionally, wait
/// for background activity to finish.
///
/// This method is intended to be used in automated environments which need to wait for background activity to finish
/// before executing requests that rely on that background activity to finish. Examples of such cases are:
/// - Automated tests that need to wait for background indexing to finish and then checking the result of request
///   results
/// - Automated tests that need to wait for requests like file changes to be handled and checking behavior after those
///   have been processed
/// - Code analysis tools that want to use SourceKit-LSP to gather information about the project but can only do so
///   after the index has been loaded
///
/// Because this request waits for all other SourceKit-LSP requests to finish, it limits parallel request handling and
/// is ill-suited for any kind of interactive environment. In those environments, it is preferable to quickly give the
/// user a result based on the data that is available and (immutable the user) re-perform the action if the underlying index
/// data has changed.
