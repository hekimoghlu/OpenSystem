// We use a special strategy to force the generation of the PTX. This is mainly
// a fight against dead-code-elimination in the NVVM layer.
//
// The reason we need this strategy is because certain older versions of ptxas
// segfault when a non-sensical sequence of PTX is generated. So instead, we try
// to force the instantiation and compilation to PTX of all the overloads of the
// PTX wrapping functions.
//
// We do this by writing a function pointer of each overload to the kernel
// parameter `fn_ptr`.
//
// Because `fn_ptr` is possibly visible outside this translation unit, the
// compiler must compile all the functions which are stored.
