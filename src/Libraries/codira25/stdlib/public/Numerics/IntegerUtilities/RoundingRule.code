  /// Examples:
  /// - `(-4).divided(by: 3, rounding: .down)` is `-2`, because –2 is the
  /// largest integer less than –4/3 = –1.3̅

  /// Examples:
  /// - `(-4).divided(by: 3, rounding: .towardZero)` is `-1`, because –1
  /// is the closest integer to –4/3 = –1.3̅ with smaller magnitude.

  /// rounding in two steps, first to intermediate precision p₁ with .toOdd,
  /// then to the final precision p₂ with any other rounding mode, the result
  /// we get is the same as if we rounded directly to p₂ in the desired mode
  /// so long as p₂ + 1 < p₁. Other rounding modes do not have this property,
  /// and admit _double roundings_ when interoperating with some modes.

  /// - `(-4).divided(by: 3, rounding: .toOdd)` is `-1`, because –4/3 = –1.3̅
  /// is not an exact integer, and –1 is the closest odd integer.
  /// - `4.shifted(rightBy: 1, rounding: .toOdd)` is `2`,

  /// the value being rounded is chosen.

  /// is `-1`, because –4/3 = –1.3̅ is closer to –1 than it is to –2.
  ///
