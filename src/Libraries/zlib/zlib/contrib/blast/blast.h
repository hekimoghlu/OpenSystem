 * blast() decompresses the PKWare Data Compression Library (DCL) compressed
 * format.  It provides the same functionality as the explode() function in
 * that library.  (Note: PKWare overused the "implode" verb, and the format
 * used by their library implode() function is completely different and
 * incompatible with the implode compression method supported by PKZIP.)
 *
 * The binary mode for stdio functions should be used to assure that the
 * compressed data is not corrupted when read or written.  For example:
 * fopen(..., "rb") and fopen(..., "wb").

/* Decompress input to output using the provided infun() and outfun() calls.
 * On success, the return value of blast() is zero.  If there is an error in
 * the source data, i.e. it is not in the proper format, then a negative value
 * is returned.  If there is not enough input available or there is not enough
 * output space, then a positive error is returned.
 *
 * The input function is invoked: len = infun(how, &buf), where buf is set by
 * infun() to point to the input buffer, and infun() returns the number of
 * available bytes there.  If infun() returns zero, then blast() returns with
 * an input error.  (blast() only asks for input if it needs it.)  inhow is for
 * use by the application to pass an input descriptor to infun(), if desired.
 *
 * If left and in are not NULL and *left is not zero when blast() is called,
 * then the *left bytes at *in are consumed for input before infun() is used.
 *
 * The output function is invoked: err = outfun(how, buf, len), where the bytes
 * to be written are buf[0..len-1].  If err is not zero, then blast() returns
 * with an output error.  outfun() is always called with len <= 4096.  outhow
 * is for use by the application to pass an output descriptor to outfun(), if
 * desired.
 *
 * If there is any unused input, *left is set to the number of bytes that were
 * read and *in points to them.  Otherwise *left is set to zero and *in is set
 * to NULL.  If left or in are NULL, then they are not set.
 *
 * The return codes are:
 *
 *   2:  ran out of input before completing decompression
 *   1:  output error before completing decompression
 *   0:  successful decompression
 *  -1:  literal flag not zero or one
 *  -2:  dictionary size not in 4..6
 *  -3:  distance is too far back
 *
 * At the bottom of blast.c is an example program that uses blast() that can be
 * compiled to produce a command-line decompression filter by defining TEST.
