/*
 * The dirent structure defines the format of directory entries.
 *
 * A directory entry has a struct dirent at the front of it, containing its
 * inode number, the length of the entry, and the length of the name
 * contained in the entry.  These are followed by the name padded to a 4
 * byte boundary with null bytes.  All names are guaranteed null terminated.
 * The maximum length of a name in a directory is MAXNAMLEN when 32-bit
 * ino_t is in effect; (MAXPATHLEN - 1) when 64-bit ino_t is in effect.
