 *	mach_port_t - a named port right
 *
 *	In user-space, "rights" are represented by the name of the
 *	right in the Mach port namespace.  Even so, this type is
 *	presented as a unique one to more clearly denote the presence
 *	of a right coming along with the name.
 *
 *	Often, various rights for a port held in a single name space
 *	will coalesce and are, therefore, be identified by a single name
 *	[this is the case for send and receive rights].  But not
 *	always [send-once rights currently get a unique name for
 *	each right].
 *
 *	This definition of mach_port_t is only for user-space.
