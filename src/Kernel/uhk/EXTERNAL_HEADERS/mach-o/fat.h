/*
 * This header file describes the structures of the file format for "fat"
 * architecture specific file (wrapper design).  At the begining of the file
 * there is one fat_header structure followed by a number of fat_arch
 * structures.  For each architecture in the file, specified by a pair of
 * cputype and cpusubtype, the fat_header describes the file offset, file
 * size and alignment in the file of the architecture specific member.
 * The padded bytes in the file to place each member on it's specific alignment
 * are defined to be read as zeros and can be left as "holes" if the file system
 * can support them as long as they read as zeros.
 *
 * All structures defined here are always written and read to/from disk
 * in big-endian order.

/*
 * <mach/machine.h> is needed here for the cpu_type_t and cpu_subtype_t types
